<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Creamy Avocado Pasta is a vibrant and nourishing dish that combines the richness of ripe avocados with the comfort of warm pasta. The sauce is silky and smooth, made by blending avocado with garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and seasonings. The result is a luscious, green coating that clings beautifully to each strand of pasta, offering a fresh, tangy, and slightly nutty flavor in every bite.</p>
<p>Unlike heavy cream-based sauces, this version is light, dairy-optional, and packed with healthy fats and antioxidants. It’s quick to prepare—perfect for busy weeknights—but elegant enough to impress guests. Topped with cherry tomatoes, herbs, or a touch of chili flakes, it becomes a colorful, refreshing meal that feels both indulgent and clean.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>12 oz (340g) pasta (spaghetti, linguine, or penne)</li>
<li>2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice (freshly squeezed)</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh basil or parsley (optional)</li>
<li>Cherry tomatoes or chili flakes for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li>Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
<li>While the pasta cooks, add the avocados, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, Parmesan (if using), salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up to your desired consistency.</li>
<li>Toss the drained pasta with the avocado sauce until fully coated.</li>
<li>Optional: Garnish with halved cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, parsley, or a pinch of chili flakes for added flavor and color.</li>
<li>Serve immediately, as the avocado sauce is best when fresh.</li>
</ol>
