<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Garlic Butter Roasted Mushrooms are a rich, savory side dish that brings out the earthy flavor of mushrooms with the indulgent touch of garlic and melted butter. As they roast in the oven, the mushrooms become tender and juicy, absorbing the garlicky butter and aromatic herbs. The high heat allows them to caramelize slightly on the edges, giving each bite a perfect balance of softness and depth of flavor.</p>
<p>This dish is incredibly versatile—served warm as a side to steak, chicken, or pasta, or even spooned over toast or rice for a simple vegetarian meal. A sprinkle of fresh parsley adds a pop of color and brightness, while a dusting of Parmesan (if used) introduces a nutty, salty finish that complements the umami of the mushrooms beautifully. It’s comfort food with elegance—easy to prepare but rich in taste.</p>
