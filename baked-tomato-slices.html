<h1>Description</h1>
<p1>Baked tomato slices are a simple yet flavorful dish made by layering fresh, ripe tomato slices on a baking sheet, seasoning them with herbs and spices, and roasting them in the oven until tender and slightly caramelized. Typically, the tomatoes are sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic, and dried or fresh herbs like basil, oregano, or thyme. Some variations include a topping of grated cheese—such as Parmesan or mozzarella—which melts and forms a delicious, golden crust. The baking process intensifies the natural sweetness of the tomatoes and brings out a savory depth that's both comforting and light.</p>
<p>This dish is incredibly versatile and can be served as a side, appetizer, or even a light main course when paired with crusty bread or a salad. It's particularly popular in the summer when tomatoes are in peak season and bursting with flavor. Baked tomato slices are not only easy to prepare but also healthy, low in calories, and rich in antioxidants like lycopene. Whether you're looking for a quick snack or a vibrant addition to your dinner table, this dish offers a perfect balance of simplicity and taste.</p>
